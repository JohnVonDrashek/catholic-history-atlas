    "summary": "Marcionism was a major heretical movement founded by Marcion of Sinope around 144 AD. Marcion rejected the Old Testament and most of the New Testament, accepting only an edited version of Luke's Gospel and ten of Paul's letters. His dualistic theology, which posited two separate gods (the creator God of the Old Testament and the loving God of the New), was vigorously opposed by the early Church and led to the development of the New Testament canon.",

    "summary": "Montanism, also known as the New Prophecy, was an early Christian movement founded by Montanus in Phrygia around 165 AD. It emphasized prophetic revelation, ecstatic utterances, and strict asceticism. The movement was eventually condemned as heretical, but it influenced Christian thinking about prophecy, the Holy Spirit, and eschatology.",

The most notable episode was the persecution in Lyons and Vienne in 177 AD, which resulted in the martyrdom of many Christians including the elderly bishop Pothinus and the slave Blandina. This persecution is documented in the 'Letter of the Churches of Lyons and Vienne.'",

    "summary": "The Muratorian Canon, dating from around 170-200 AD, is the earliest known list of New Testament books. Discovered in the 18th century, it provides crucial evidence for the early formation of the biblical canon, listing most of the books now accepted as canonical and excluding others. It demonstrates that the core of the New Testament was already established by the late 2nd century.",
