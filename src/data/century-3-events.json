Emperor Decius issued an edict requiring all citizens to perform a sacrifice to the Roman gods and obtain a certificate (libellus) proving their compliance. Many Christians refused and were martyred, while others lapsed and later sought readmission to the Church, leading to debates about penance and reconciliation.",

The schism lasted for several centuries and was eventually condemned by the Church.",
