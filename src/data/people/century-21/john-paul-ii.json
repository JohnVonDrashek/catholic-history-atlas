His 27-year pontificate was one of the longest in history. He traveled extensively, visiting 129 countries. He played a crucial role in the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. He promulgated the 1983 Code of Canon Law and the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992). He canonized more saints than all previous popes combined.
