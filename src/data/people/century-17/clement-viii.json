He revised the Vulgate Bible and the Roman Missal, Breviary, and Pontifical. He reconciled Henry IV of France to the Catholic Church, ending decades of conflict. He established the Congregation of Rites. He was known for his piety and his efforts to implement the reforms of the Council of Trent. His pontificate strengthened the Church's position in the post-Reformation era.",
