  "summary": "Innocent XI, born Benedetto Odescalchi, was Pope from 1676 to 1689. He is remembered for his moral reform of the papacy and his fight against nepotism. He was a strong opponent of Louis XIV of France's claims to control the French Church (Gallicanism). He supported the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire, which led to the liberation of Vienna in 1683. He condemned quietism and worked to reform the Church's finances. He was beatified in 1956.",
