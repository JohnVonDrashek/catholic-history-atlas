  "summary": "Kateri Tekakwitha, also known as the Lily of the Mohawks, was a Mohawk-Algonquin woman who converted to Christianity. She was born in what is now New York State and was orphaned by smallpox, which also left her partially blind. She converted to Catholicism at age 20 and dedicated her life to prayer and penance. She is the first Native American to be canonized and is the patron saint of ecology, the environment, and Native Americans.",
