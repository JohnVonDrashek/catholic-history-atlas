  "summary": "Innocent X, born Giovanni Battista Pamphilj, was Pope from 1644 to 1655. He is known for condemning Jansenism in 1653 with the bull 'Cum occasione.' He worked to reduce nepotism but was influenced by his sister-in-law, Donna Olimpia Maidalchini. He supported the Peace of Westphalia (1648), though he protested some of its terms. He was a patron of the arts, commissioning works by Bernini and others. His portrait by Velázquez is one of the most famous papal portraits in art history.",
