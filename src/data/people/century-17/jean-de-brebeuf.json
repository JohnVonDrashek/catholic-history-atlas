  "summary": "Jean de Brébeuf was a French Jesuit missionary who worked among the Huron people in New France (present-day Canada). He learned the Huron language and wrote a Huron dictionary and catechism. He was known for his physical strength and endurance, which earned him the Huron name 'Echon.' He was captured and martyred by the Iroquois in 1649, suffering brutal torture. He is one of the North American Martyrs.",
