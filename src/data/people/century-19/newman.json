  "summary": "John Henry Newman was an English theologian, poet, and cardinal who converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism in 1845. He was a leading figure in the Oxford Movement, which sought to restore Catholic elements to Anglicanism. After his conversion, he became a Catholic priest and later a cardinal. He founded the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in England and wrote extensively on faith, reason, and education. He was beatified in 2010 and canonized in 2019. (Note: Canonized after his death in the 20th century, but his life and work were primarily in the 19th century.)",
