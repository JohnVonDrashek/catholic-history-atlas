  "summary": "Pius VII was Pope from 1800 to 1823. His pontificate was dominated by his relationship with Napoleon Bonaparte, who imprisoned him from 1809 to 1814. Despite this persecution, Pius VII showed remarkable courage and diplomacy. After Napoleon's fall, he restored the Society of Jesus and worked to rebuild the Church. He was a Benedictine monk before his election and was known for his personal holiness and administrative skills.",
