  "summary": "Bernadette Soubirous was a French peasant girl who, at the age of 14, witnessed 18 apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in a grotto near Lourdes in 1858. The apparition identified herself as 'the Immaculate Conception' and revealed a spring with healing properties. Bernadette later became a nun with the Sisters of Charity of Nevers and lived a life of humility and suffering. Lourdes became one of the world's most important pilgrimage sites.",
