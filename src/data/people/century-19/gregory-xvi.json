  "summary": "Gregory XVI was Pope from 1831 to 1846. A Camaldolese monk before his election, he was the last non-bishop to be elected pope. His pontificate was marked by conservative policies, opposition to liberal and nationalist movements, and support for missionary activity. He condemned the slave trade, expanded the College of Cardinals, and was a patron of the arts and learning. He established the Etruscan and Egyptian museums in the Vatican.",
