  "summary": "Photinus was Bishop of Sirmium in the 4th century who taught a form of Adoptionism. He denied the pre-existence and divinity of Christ, teaching that Jesus was a mere man who was adopted as the Son of God. He also denied the distinct personality of the Holy Spirit. His teachings combined elements of Adoptionism and Sabellianism. He was condemned and deposed by synods in Milan (345), Sirmium (351), and Arles (353). St. Hilary of Poitiers wrote against his teachings. Photinus' Adoptionist views were similar to those of Paul of Samosata.",
