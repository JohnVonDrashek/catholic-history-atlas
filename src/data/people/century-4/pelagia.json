  "summary": "Pelagia was a Christian virgin martyr who died in Antioch. According to tradition, she was a beautiful young woman who was pursued by a Roman official. To preserve her virginity, she threw herself from a rooftop rather than submit to him. She is venerated as a saint and is an example of the early Christian women who chose death over compromising their faith and virtue.",
