  "summary": "Agnes was a young Roman girl who was martyred at the age of 12 or 13 during the Diocletian persecution. According to tradition, she refused to marry and remained a consecrated virgin, declaring that she was already betrothed to Christ. She was executed by beheading. She is one of the most venerated virgin martyrs and is the patron saint of girls, chastity, and rape survivors. Her name means 'lamb' in Latin, and she is often depicted with a lamb.",
