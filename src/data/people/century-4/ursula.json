  "summary": "Ursula was a British princess and Christian martyr who, according to legend, was martyred in Cologne along with 11,000 virgin companions. The legend tells of her pilgrimage to Rome with 11,000 virgins, who were all martyred by the Huns in Cologne. While the number is likely legendary, there is historical evidence of a group of Christian women martyred in Cologne. She is the patron saint of Cologne, students, and the Order of Ursulines.",
