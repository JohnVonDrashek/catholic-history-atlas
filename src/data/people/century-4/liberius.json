  "summary": "Liberius was Pope from 352 to 366. His pontificate was marked by the Arian controversy. He was exiled by Emperor Constantius II for refusing to condemn St. Athanasius, but was allowed to return after signing ambiguous documents. He is the first pope not to be venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. His pontificate reflects the complex politics of the Arian controversy and the relationship between the papacy and the Roman emperors.",
