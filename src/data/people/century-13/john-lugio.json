  "summary": "John of Lugio was a 13th-century Cathar bishop and theologian who developed a more sophisticated form of Cathar dualism. He wrote 'The Book of Two Principles,' which presented a systematic dualistic theology. He taught that there were two eternal principles: good (God) and evil (Satan), and that the material world was created by the evil principle. His teachings represented a more philosophical form of Catharism compared to the simpler dualism of earlier Cathars. He was active during the Albigensian Crusade and his writings influenced later Cathar thought.",
