  "summary": "Gregory X, born Tebaldo Visconti, was Pope from 1271 to 1276. He was elected after a papal vacancy of almost three years. He called the Second Council of Lyon (1274), which achieved a brief union between the Greek and Latin Churches. He worked to organize a new crusade and established regulations for papal conclaves, including the requirement that cardinals be locked in until they elect a pope. He is venerated as Blessed in the Catholic Church. His pontificate was marked by efforts to reunite Eastern and Western Christianity.",
