  "summary": "Roger Bacon was an English Franciscan friar, philosopher, and experimental scientist. Known as 'Doctor Mirabilis' (Wonderful Teacher), he was one of the first European advocates of the modern scientific method. He emphasized the importance of experimental verification and the study of languages, mathematics, and optics. His works on optics, astronomy, and alchemy were ahead of their time, and he predicted many future inventions including microscopes and telescopes.",
