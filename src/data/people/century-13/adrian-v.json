  "summary": "Adrian V, born Ottobuono de' Fieschi, was Pope for only about one month in 1276. He was elected pope but died before his coronation. His brief pontificate prevented him from taking any significant actions. He was a nephew of Pope Innocent IV and had served as a papal legate. He is remembered primarily for his extremely short reign, one of the briefest in papal history.",
