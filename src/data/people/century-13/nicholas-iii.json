  "summary": "Nicholas III, born Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, was Pope from 1277 to 1280. He was a member of the powerful Orsini family and engaged in significant nepotism, appointing many relatives to important positions. He worked to strengthen papal authority in the Papal States and negotiated with the Holy Roman Empire. He established the Vatican as the permanent papal residence. He is mentioned in Dante's Inferno for his simony. His pontificate was marked by political maneuvering and the consolidation of Orsini family power.",
