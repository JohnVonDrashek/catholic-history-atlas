  "summary": "John XXI, born Pedro Julião (Peter of Spain), was Pope from 1276 to 1277. He was Portuguese and had been a physician and professor before becoming pope. He is remembered for his scholarly work, particularly in logic and medicine. He died when the ceiling of his study collapsed on him. His brief pontificate was marked by his intellectual pursuits. He worked to organize a crusade but died before it could be launched.",
