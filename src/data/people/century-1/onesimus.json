  "summary": "Onesimus was a runaway slave from Colossae who encountered Paul in Rome and was converted to Christianity. Paul wrote the Epistle to Philemon on Onesimus' behalf, asking Philemon to receive him back 'no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother.' The letter demonstrates the transformative power of the Gospel, which makes all believers equal in Christ. According to tradition, Onesimus later became bishop of Ephesus and was martyred in Rome by stoning.",
