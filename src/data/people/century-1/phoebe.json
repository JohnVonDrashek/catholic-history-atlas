  "summary": "Phoebe was a deacon of the church in Cenchreae, a port city near Corinth. She is mentioned by Paul in his Epistle to the Romans, where he commends her as a patron and asks the Roman church to receive her and assist her. She is believed to have been the bearer of Paul's letter to the Romans, making her the first person to deliver a canonical epistle. Her role as a deacon and patron demonstrates the important leadership roles women held in the early Church.",
