  "summary": "Apollos was a Jewish Christian from Alexandria who became an important early Christian missionary and teacher. He was an eloquent speaker and well-versed in Scripture. According to the Acts of the Apostles, he came to Ephesus where Priscilla and Aquila instructed him more accurately in the Christian faith. He then went to Corinth, where he became a prominent teacher and preacher. Paul mentions him favorably in his letters, and Apollos is considered one of the most important early Christian missionaries after the apostles.",
