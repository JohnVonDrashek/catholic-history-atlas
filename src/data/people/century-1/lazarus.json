He is most famous for being raised from the dead by Jesus four days after his death, one of Jesus' most dramatic miracles. According to tradition, after the Resurrection, Lazarus was forced to flee Judea and became the first bishop of Kition (Larnaca) in Cyprus, where he lived for thirty years. His resurrection prefigures the general resurrection of the dead.",
