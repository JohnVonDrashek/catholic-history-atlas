Jesus explained to him the necessity of being 'born again' through water and the Spirit. Nicodemus later defended Jesus before the Sanhedrin and, together with Joseph of Arimathea, prepared Jesus' body for burial with a mixture of myrrh and aloes. He is venerated as a saint in both Eastern and Western traditions.",
