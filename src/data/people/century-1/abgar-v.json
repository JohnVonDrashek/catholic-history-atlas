  "summary": "Abgar V, also known as Abgar the Black, was the king of Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey) who, according to the legend of Abgar, corresponded with Jesus Christ and was the first Christian king. The legend states that he wrote to Jesus asking to be healed, and Jesus responded with a letter. After the Ascension, Thaddeus (Addai) was sent to Edessa and converted Abgar and his kingdom. While the historicity of the correspondence is debated, Abgar's conversion to Christianity is significant for the early spread of Christianity in Mesopotamia.",
