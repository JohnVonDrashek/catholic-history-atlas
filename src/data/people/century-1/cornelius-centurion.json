  "summary": "Cornelius was a Roman centurion in Caesarea Maritima who became the first Gentile convert to Christianity. He was a devout and God-fearing man who received a vision instructing him to send for Peter. When Peter arrived and preached the Gospel, the Holy Spirit fell upon Cornelius and his household, confirming that the Gospel was for Gentiles as well as Jews. This event was crucial in opening the Church to all nations. According to tradition, he became the first bishop of Caesarea.",
