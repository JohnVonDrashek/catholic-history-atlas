  "summary": "Clement VII, born Giulio de' Medici, was Pope from 1523 to 1534. Another Medici pope, his pontificate was marked by political difficulties, including the Sack of Rome in 1527 by troops of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. He refused to grant King Henry VIII of England an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, which led to England's break with Rome and the establishment of the Church of England. Despite these challenges, he was a patron of the arts and supported Michelangelo's work on the Sistine Chapel.",
