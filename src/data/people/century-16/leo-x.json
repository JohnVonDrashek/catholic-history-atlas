  "summary": "Leo X, born Giovanni de' Medici, was Pope from 1513 to 1521. A member of the powerful Medici family, he was a patron of the arts and continued the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica. His papacy is most remembered for his excommunication of Martin Luther in 1521, which formalized the break that led to the Protestant Reformation. He convened the Fifth Lateran Council and worked to strengthen papal authority, though his need for funds to complete St. Peter's led to increased sale of indulgences that became a target of Luther's criticism.",
