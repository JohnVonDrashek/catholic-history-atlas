  "summary": "Paul IV, born Giovanni Pietro Carafa, was Pope from 1555 to 1559. A strong proponent of the Counter-Reformation, he established the Roman Ghetto and the Index of Forbidden Books. He was known for his strict enforcement of orthodoxy and his suspicion of Protestantism. He strengthened the Inquisition and was critical of the Jesuits, though he eventually approved them. His pontificate was marked by his zealous commitment to Church reform and combating heresy.",
