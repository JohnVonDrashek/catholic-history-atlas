He is best known for commissioning the Gregorian Calendar reform in 1582, which corrected errors in the Julian Calendar and is still in use today. He was a strong supporter of the Counter-Reformation, founding seminaries and colleges, including the Gregorian University in Rome. He supported missionary efforts, especially in the Far East. He also completed the construction of several important buildings in Rome. His calendar reform was one of the most significant achievements of his pontificate.",
