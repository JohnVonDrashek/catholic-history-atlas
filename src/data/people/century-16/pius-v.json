A Dominican friar before his election, he was known for his personal holiness and strict enforcement of Church discipline. He published the Roman Catechism, the revised Roman Breviary, and the revised Roman Missal. He organized the Holy League that defeated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, which he attributed to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary.",
