  "summary": "Philip Neri was an Italian priest known as the 'Apostle of Rome' and the 'Second Apostle of Rome' (after St. Peter). He founded the Congregation of the Oratory in 1575, a community of secular priests dedicated to prayer, preaching, and service. Known for his joy, humor, and love of the poor, he was a key figure in the Counter-Reformation. He is the patron saint of joy and is remembered for his ecstatic experiences of the Holy Spirit.",
