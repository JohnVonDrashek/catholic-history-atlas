  "summary": "Margaret Clitherow was an English Catholic martyr known as the 'Pearl of York.' She converted to Catholicism and secretly harbored priests during the Elizabethan persecution. Despite being pregnant, she was arrested and pressed to death for refusing to enter a plea, which would have forced her children to testify against her. She is one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales and is remembered for her courage and devotion to the Catholic faith.",
