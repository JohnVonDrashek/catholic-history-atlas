  "summary": "Paul III, born Alessandro Farnese, was Pope from 1534 to 1549. He is best known for convening the Council of Trent in 1545, which launched the Catholic Counter-Reformation. He approved the establishment of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and the Ursulines, and he reformed the Roman Inquisition. He excommunicated Henry VIII of England in 1538. A patron of the arts, he completed the reconstruction of St. Peter's Basilica and commissioned Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment' in the Sistine Chapel. His pontificate marked a turning point in the Church's response to the Protestant Reformation.",
