He was Dutch and had been a professor of theology and tutor to the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. His brief pontificate occurred during the early years of the Protestant Reformation. He attempted to reform the Church and address corruption, but his efforts were met with resistance. He was the last pope to retain his baptismal name upon election.",
