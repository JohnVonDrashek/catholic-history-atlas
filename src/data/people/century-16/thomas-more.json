  "summary": "Thomas More was an English lawyer, statesman, philosopher, and humanist who served as Lord Chancellor of England under Henry VIII. He is best known for his book 'Utopia' and for his martyrdom. When Henry VIII broke with Rome and declared himself head of the Church of England, More refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, choosing death rather than compromise his Catholic faith. He was beheaded in 1535 and is the patron saint of lawyers and statesmen.",
