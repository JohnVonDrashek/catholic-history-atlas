  "summary": "John Rigby was an English Catholic layman and martyr who was executed during the reign of Elizabeth I. He was a servant who refused to attend Protestant services. When he appeared in court on behalf of his employer's daughter, he was asked about his own religion and admitted to being Catholic. He was arrested, tried, and executed at St. Thomas Waterings. He is one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales and is remembered for his simple courage in professing his faith.",
