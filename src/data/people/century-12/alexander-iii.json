  "summary": "Alexander III was Pope from 1159 to 1181. His pontificate was marked by a long schism with antipopes supported by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. He convened the Third Lateran Council in 1179, which established the two-thirds majority requirement for papal elections. He supported Thomas Becket in his conflict with Henry II of England and canonized Becket after his martyrdom.",
