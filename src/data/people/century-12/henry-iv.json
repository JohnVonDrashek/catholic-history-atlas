  "summary": "Henry IV was Holy Roman Emperor from 1084 to 1106. He is best known for his conflict with Pope Gregory VII during the Investiture Controversy, which culminated in his famous penance at Canossa in 1077. This event symbolized the struggle between papal and imperial authority. Despite his excommunication and deposition, he continued to rule and eventually forced Gregory VII into exile. His reign was marked by ongoing conflict with the papacy and German princes.",
