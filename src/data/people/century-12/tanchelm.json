  "summary": "Tanchelm was a 12th-century Flemish preacher who was condemned as a heretic. He rejected the authority of the clergy, denied the Real Presence in the Eucharist, and taught that the sacraments were invalid if administered by unworthy priests. He gained a large following in Antwerp and the surrounding regions, where he was seen as a reformer. He was eventually killed by a priest in 1115. His teachings influenced later anti-clerical movements. St. Norbert of Xanten preached against his followers and helped restore orthodoxy in the region.",
