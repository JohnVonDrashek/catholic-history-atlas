  "summary": "Innocent II was Pope from 1130 to 1143. His pontificate was marked by a schism with the antipope Anacletus II, which was resolved with the support of Bernard of Clairvaux and the German Emperor Lothair III. He convened the Second Lateran Council in 1139, which condemned the antipope and addressed various Church reforms. He also supported the Second Crusade.",
