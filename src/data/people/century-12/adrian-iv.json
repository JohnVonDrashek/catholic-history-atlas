  "summary": "Adrian IV, born Nicholas Breakspear, was Pope from 1154 to 1159. He was the only Englishman ever to become pope. He crowned Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. He granted Ireland to King Henry II of England with the papal bull 'Laudabiliter' in 1155, though this is disputed by some historians. He dealt with the political turmoil in Rome, including the execution of Arnold of Brescia. His pontificate was marked by conflicts with the Roman nobility and the Holy Roman Emperor.",
