  "summary": "Anastasius IV, born Corrado della Suburra, was Pope from 1153 to 1154. His brief pontificate was relatively peaceful compared to those of his predecessors. He worked to improve relations with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and the Roman Commune. He granted privileges to various religious orders and worked to maintain stability in the Church. He was elected at an advanced age and his short reign reflects his elderly status at election.",
