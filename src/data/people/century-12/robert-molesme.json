  "summary": "Robert of Molesme was a French abbot and the founder of the Cistercian Order. Seeking to follow the Rule of St. Benedict more strictly, he left Molesme Abbey in 1098 with a group of monks to establish a new monastery at Cîteaux (Cistercium in Latin), which gave the order its name. The Cistercians emphasized manual labor, simplicity, and strict observance of the Benedictine Rule, reacting against what they saw as the laxity and worldliness of Cluny. Robert was called back to Molesme but is considered the first abbot of Cîteaux.",
