  "summary": "Callistus II, born Guido of Burgundy, was Pope from 1119 to 1124. He is best known for ending the Investiture Controversy by signing the Concordat of Worms with Holy Roman Emperor Henry V in 1122. This agreement settled the long-standing dispute over whether secular rulers could appoint bishops. He also called the First Lateran Council in 1123, the first general council held in the West. His pontificate marked the resolution of one of the major conflicts of the Gregorian Reform period.",
