  "summary": "Apollonius was a Christian apologist and senator who was martyred in Rome around 185 during the reign of Commodus. According to Eusebius, he was a learned man who wrote an apology for Christianity. When brought before the Roman authorities, he delivered a defense of the Christian faith and was beheaded. His 'Apology' was highly regarded in the early Church, though only fragments survive.",
