  "summary": "Maturus was a recent convert (neophyte) and one of the martyrs of Lyons who died in 177 during the persecution of Marcus Aurelius. Despite being newly baptized, he showed remarkable courage and faith. According to the account preserved by Eusebius, he was tortured in the arena along with Sanctus, Attalus, and Blandina, and then executed. His willingness to die for his faith so soon after conversion was seen as a powerful testimony to the strength of Christian conviction.",
