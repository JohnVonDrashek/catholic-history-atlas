  "summary": "Attalus was one of the martyrs of Lyons who died in 177 during the persecution of Marcus Aurelius. He was a prominent member of the Christian community in Lyons and was known for his strong faith. According to the account preserved by Eusebius, he was subjected to torture in the arena and then burned at the stake. His martyrdom, along with that of Blandina, Sanctus, Maturus, and others, is one of the most detailed accounts of early Christian martyrdom and had a profound impact on the Church in Gaul.",
