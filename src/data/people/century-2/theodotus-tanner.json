  "summary": "Theodotus the Tanner was a 2nd-century Adoptionist heretic who taught in Rome. He was the leader of the Theodotians, who taught that Jesus was a mere man who was adopted as the Son of God at his baptism. This form of Adoptionism denied the pre-existence and divinity of Christ. Theodotus was excommunicated by Pope Victor I around 190. His teachings were opposed by Hippolytus of Rome and other early Church Fathers. The Adoptionist heresy would later resurface in Spain in the 8th century.",
