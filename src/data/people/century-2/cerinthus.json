  "summary": "Cerinthus was an early Christian heretic active in Asia Minor around the end of the 1st century. He taught a form of Gnosticism that combined Jewish and Christian elements. He denied the divinity of Christ, teaching that Jesus was merely a man upon whom the Christ descended at baptism and departed before the crucifixion. He also taught a form of millenarianism, believing in a literal thousand-year reign of Christ on earth. His teachings were opposed by St. John the Evangelist and early Church Fathers.",
