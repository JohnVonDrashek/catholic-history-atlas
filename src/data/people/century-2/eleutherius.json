  "summary": "Eleutherius was Bishop of Rome from about 175 to 189. According to the Liber Pontificalis, he received a letter from King Lucius of Britain requesting missionaries, though this account is considered legendary. He is traditionally considered a martyr, though historical evidence for this is uncertain. His pontificate saw the continued growth of the Church and the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.",
