  "summary": "Hegesippus was a 2nd-century Christian chronicler and historian. He was a Jewish convert to Christianity who traveled to Rome and wrote a five-volume work called 'Memoirs' or 'Hypomnemata' that chronicled the history of the Church from the time of the apostles to his own day. His work, which survives only in fragments quoted by Eusebius, is an important source for early Church history, particularly regarding the succession of bishops and the development of heresies. He is sometimes called the 'father of Church history.'",
