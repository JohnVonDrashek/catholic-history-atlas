  "summary": "Montanus was a 2nd-century Christian from Phrygia who founded the Montanist movement, also known as the New Prophecy. He claimed to be a prophet and, along with two women named Priscilla and Maximilla, claimed to receive direct revelations from the Holy Spirit. The movement emphasized prophecy, strict asceticism, and the imminent return of Christ. Montanism was condemned as heretical by the Church, though it attracted some notable figures including Tertullian. The movement persisted for several centuries, particularly in Phrygia.",
