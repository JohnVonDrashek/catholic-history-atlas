  "summary": "Marcion of Sinope was a 2nd-century Christian theologian and heretic who founded the Marcionite church. He rejected the Old Testament and taught that the God of the Old Testament was different from and inferior to the God of the New Testament. He created his own canon of Scripture, accepting only a modified version of the Gospel of Luke and ten of Paul's letters. His teachings were condemned by the early Church, and he was excommunicated in Rome around 144. The Marcionite church survived for several centuries.",
