  "summary": "Alexander was a physician from Phrygia and one of the martyrs of Lyons who died in 177 during the persecution of Marcus Aurelius. He had come to Gaul to practice medicine and became a member of the Christian community in Lyons. According to the account preserved by Eusebius, he was recognized in the crowd during the persecution and was arrested. He was tortured and then executed along with the other martyrs. His profession as a physician and his willingness to die for his faith made him a notable figure among the martyrs of Lyons.",
