  "summary": "Honorius I was Pope from 625 to 638. He is historically significant because he was posthumously condemned as a heretic at the Third Council of Constantinople (680-681) for his views on Monothelitism, the doctrine that Christ had only one will. He wrote letters that seemed to support this position, though the exact nature of his views remains debated. This condemnation was unique in papal history and remains a matter of theological discussion regarding papal infallibility. He also worked to convert the Lombards and supported missionary efforts in England.",
