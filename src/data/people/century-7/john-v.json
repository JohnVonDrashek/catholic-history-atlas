  "summary": "John V was Pope from 685 to 686. He was of Syrian origin, the first pope to come from the Eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire. His brief pontificate was marked by attempts to improve relations with the Byzantine Emperor and Patriarch. He tried to resolve disputes between Eastern and Western Churches. His papacy reflects the ongoing tensions and interactions between Rome and Constantinople during the 7th century.",
