He was sent by the Arian Ostrogoth king Theodoric the Great to Constantinople to negotiate on behalf of the Arians, but he instead worked to protect the orthodox. Upon his return, Theodoric imprisoned him in Ravenna, where he died of starvation and is considered a martyr. He is the first pope to have traveled to Constantinople while in office.",
