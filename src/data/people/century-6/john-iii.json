  "summary": "John III was Pope from 561 to 574. His pontificate occurred during a period of great difficulty for Rome, as the city was repeatedly threatened by the Lombards. He worked to protect the city and its inhabitants, seeking help from the Byzantine Empire. He tried to maintain relations with both the Eastern and Western Churches during a time of growing tensions. His papacy reflects the challenges faced by the Church in Italy during the Byzantine-Lombard conflicts.",
