He is best known for his hymns, including 'Vexilla Regis' and 'Pange Lingua Gloriosi Proelium Certaminis,' which are still used in the liturgy. He was a friend of St. Radegund and wrote extensively about the saints and religious life in Merovingian Gaul. His poetry helped preserve classical Latin verse forms during the early Middle Ages.",
