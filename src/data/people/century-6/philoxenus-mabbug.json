  "summary": "Philoxenus was Bishop of Mabbug (Hierapolis) and a leading Monophysite theologian. He strongly opposed the Council of Chalcedon and the Tome of Leo, teaching that Christ had one nature after the Incarnation. He was a prolific writer in Syriac and played a key role in the revision of the Syriac Bible translation (the Peshitta). He was exiled by the Byzantine emperor Justin I in 519 and died in exile. His writings were influential in the Syriac Orthodox Church. He was martyred during the persecution of Monophysites under Justin I.",
