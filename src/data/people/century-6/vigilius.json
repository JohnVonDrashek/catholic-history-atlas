  "summary": "Vigilius was pope from 537 to 555 during the reign of Emperor Justinian I. His pontificate was marked by the Three Chapters controversy, in which he was caught between the demands of the Eastern emperor and the Western bishops. He spent much of his pontificate in Constantinople, where he was pressured by Justinian to condemn the Three Chapters. His handling of the controversy was controversial and led to tensions between East and West.",
