  "summary": "Perpetua was a noblewoman and Christian martyr who died in Carthage during the persecution of Septimius Severus. She kept a diary of her imprisonment that is one of the earliest surviving Christian texts written by a woman and provides invaluable insight into early Christian martyrdom. Despite having a newborn child and being urged by her father to recant, she remained steadfast in her faith. She was thrown to wild beasts in the arena along with her companion Felicity and other martyrs. Her account of her visions and experiences is considered one of the most important early Christian documents.",
