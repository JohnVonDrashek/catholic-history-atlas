  "summary": "Paul of Thebes, also known as Paul the First Hermit or Paul the Anchorite, is traditionally considered the first Christian hermit. According to Jerome's 'Life of Paul', he fled to the Egyptian desert during the Decian persecution (c. 250) and lived as a hermit for nearly a century. He is said to have been visited by Anthony the Great shortly before his death. His life inspired the eremitical tradition and the establishment of monasticism in the Christian East. While much of his story comes from later hagiography, he represents the beginning of Christian monasticism.",
