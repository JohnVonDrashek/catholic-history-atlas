He is known for his letter to Caricus and Pontius, which is one of the earliest documents to use the term 'New Testament' to refer to the Christian Scriptures. He was a friend of Irenaeus of Lyons and worked to combat heresy, particularly Montanism. He is remembered for his pastoral care and his efforts to maintain orthodox doctrine in the face of various challenges.",
