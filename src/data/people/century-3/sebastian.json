  "summary": "Sebastian was a Roman soldier and Christian martyr who died during the Diocletian persecution. According to tradition, he was a captain of the Praetorian Guard who secretly converted to Christianity and helped other Christians. When his faith was discovered, he was tied to a tree and shot with arrows, but survived. He was then clubbed to death. He is one of the most venerated martyrs and is the patron saint of soldiers, athletes, and those seeking protection from plague.",
