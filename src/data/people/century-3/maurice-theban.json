  "summary": "Maurice was the leader of the Theban Legion, a Roman legion from Egypt composed entirely of Christians. According to tradition, the entire legion of 6,600 soldiers refused to participate in the persecution of Christians and was martyred in Agaunum (modern Saint-Maurice, Switzerland) by order of Emperor Maximian. Maurice is the patron saint of soldiers, swordsmiths, and the Swiss Guard. He is often depicted as a black African, reflecting the Theban Legion's Egyptian origin.",
