  "summary": "Stephen I was Pope from 254 to 257. He was martyred during the Valerian Persecution. He is known for his conflict with St. Cyprian of Carthage over the rebaptism of heretics - Stephen maintained that baptism by heretics was valid if properly administered, while Cyprian argued it was not. Stephen's position eventually became the standard Catholic teaching. He was beheaded while saying Mass, making him one of the early martyred popes.",
