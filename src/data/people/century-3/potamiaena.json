  "summary": "Potamiaena was a young Christian woman who was martyred in Alexandria during the persecution of Septimius Severus around 205 AD. According to Eusebius, she was a beautiful and virtuous woman who was subjected to various tortures but remained steadfast in her faith. She was finally executed by being slowly lowered into a cauldron of boiling pitch. Her courage and faith inspired many, including the soldier Basilides, who was converted by witnessing her martyrdom and was himself martyred shortly after. She is venerated as one of the most celebrated martyrs of Alexandria.",
