  "summary": "Pontian was Bishop of Rome from 230 to 235. During his pontificate, he dealt with the schism of Hippolytus and worked toward reconciliation. He was exiled to Sardinia by the Roman emperor Maximinus Thrax, where he resigned his office to allow for the election of a new pope. He died as a martyr in the mines of Sardinia, becoming one of the earliest popes to die in exile. His relics were later returned to Rome by Pope Fabian.",
