  "summary": "Agatha was a Christian martyr who died in Catania, Sicily, during the Decian persecution. According to tradition, she was a beautiful young woman who consecrated her virginity to God. When she refused the advances of a Roman prefect, she was tortured, including having her breasts cut off. She was then rolled over hot coals and finally died in prison. She is one of the most venerated virgin martyrs and is the patron saint of Catania, breast cancer patients, and those who work with fire. Her intercession is often sought for protection against volcanic eruptions.",
