  "summary": "Novatian was a Roman presbyter and theologian who became an antipope, creating a schism in the Church. After the Decian persecution, he took a rigorist position, arguing that those who had apostatized under persecution could not be readmitted to the Church. When the moderate Cornelius was elected pope, Novatian was consecrated as a rival bishop, creating the Novatianist schism. His followers maintained that the Church could not absolve serious post-baptismal sins. The schism persisted for several centuries, though Novatian himself was martyred during the Valerian persecution.",
