  "summary": "Carpus and Papylus were Christian martyrs who died in Pergamum during the persecution of Decius. According to the Acts of Carpus, Papylus, and Agathonice, they were arrested for refusing to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Carpus was a bishop and Papylus was a deacon. They were tortured and then burned at the stake. Their companion Agathonice, seeing their courage, also declared herself a Christian and was martyred with them. Their martyrdom is one of the most detailed accounts from the early Church.",
