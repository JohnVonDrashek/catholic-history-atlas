  "summary": "Cornelius was Bishop of Rome from 251 to 253. He faced the Novatian schism, which arose over the treatment of those who had lapsed during the Decian persecution. Cornelius, supported by St. Cyprian of Carthage, maintained that the lapsed could be readmitted to the Church after appropriate penance. He was exiled and died as a martyr. His feast day is shared with St. Cyprian.",
