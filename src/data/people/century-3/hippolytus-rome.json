  "summary": "Hippolytus was a 3rd-century theologian and the first antipope in Church history. He opposed Popes Zephyrinus and Callixtus I over doctrinal issues, but was later reconciled and martyred alongside Pope Pontian. He wrote extensively on theology, liturgy, and church order, including the 'Apostolic Tradition,' which provides valuable insights into early Christian worship.",
