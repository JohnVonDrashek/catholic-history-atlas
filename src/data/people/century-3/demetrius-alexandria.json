  "summary": "Demetrius was Bishop of Alexandria from 189 to 232, making him one of the longest-serving bishops of that see. During his episcopate, the Catechetical School of Alexandria flourished under the leadership of Clement and later Origen. He played a role in the conflict with Origen over the latter's self-castration and later theological speculations. Demetrius was instrumental in establishing the organizational structure of the Church in Egypt and maintaining orthodoxy during a period of theological development.",
