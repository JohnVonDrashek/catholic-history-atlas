  "summary": "Pius X, born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, was Pope from 1903 to 1914. He is known as the 'Pope of the Eucharist' for lowering the age of First Communion to the age of reason (about 7 years old) and encouraging frequent reception of the Eucharist. He condemned Modernism as 'the synthesis of all heresies' and promoted traditional Catholic doctrine. He reformed the Breviary, codified canon law, and restored Gregorian chant. He was canonized in 1954, the first pope to be canonized since Pius V in 1712.",
