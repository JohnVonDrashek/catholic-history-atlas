He issued the encyclical 'Mystici Corporis Christi' (1943) on the Mystical Body of Christ and 'Mediator Dei' (1947) on the liturgy. He defined the dogma of the Assumption of Mary in 1950. He promoted biblical studies and reformed the liturgy, especially the Easter Vigil. His actions during World War II regarding the Holocaust have been the subject of extensive historical debate. He supported the opening of the Second Vatican Council, which would begin under his successor.",
