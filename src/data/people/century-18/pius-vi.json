  "summary": "Pius VI was pope from 1775 to 1799, the longest pontificate up to that time. His reign was marked by the suppression of the Jesuits (which he was unable to prevent), the French Revolution, and the French invasion of the Papal States. He condemned the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and was taken prisoner by French forces in 1798. He died in exile in France, the first pope to die outside Italy in over a thousand years.",
