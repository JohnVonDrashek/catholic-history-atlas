  "summary": "Joseph Pignatelli was a Spanish Jesuit priest who played a crucial role in preserving the Society of Jesus during its suppression (1773-1814). After the suppression, he maintained the Jesuit community in Parma and later in Russia, where Catherine the Great refused to promulgate the suppression decree. He helped preserve Jesuit traditions, trained new members, and laid the groundwork for the order's restoration. He is considered the restorer of the Society of Jesus.",
