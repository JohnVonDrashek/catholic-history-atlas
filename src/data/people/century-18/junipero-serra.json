  "summary": "Junípero Serra was a Spanish Franciscan friar who founded a series of missions in California from 1769 to 1782. He established nine of the 21 Spanish missions in California, including San Diego, San Francisco, and Santa Barbara. He is credited with bringing Christianity to thousands of Native Americans, though his legacy is also controversial due to the impact of Spanish colonization on indigenous peoples. He was canonized by Pope Francis in 2015.",
