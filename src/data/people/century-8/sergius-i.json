  "summary": "Sergius I was Pope from 687 to 701. He was of Syrian origin, born in Palermo. He introduced several liturgical changes, including adding the 'Agnus Dei' to the Mass. He refused to sign the canons of the Quinisext Council (692), which were rejected by the Western Church. He consecrated Willibrord as bishop for the Frisians, supporting missionary work in Northern Europe. He worked to strengthen papal authority and maintain the independence of the Western Church from Byzantine influence.",
