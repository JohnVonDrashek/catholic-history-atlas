  "summary": "Felix was Bishop of Urgel in Spain who taught Adoptionism, a form of the heresy that denied the pre-existence and divinity of Christ. He taught that Jesus was a mere man who was adopted as the Son of God at his baptism. His teachings were condemned at the Council of Frankfurt in 794 and the Council of Aachen in 799. He was opposed by Alcuin of York and other Carolingian theologians. After being pressured by Charlemagne, he recanted his views, though the Adoptionist heresy persisted in Spain for some time.",
