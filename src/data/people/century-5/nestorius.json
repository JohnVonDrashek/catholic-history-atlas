  "summary": "Nestorius was the Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431. He is best known for his rejection of the title 'Theotokos' (God-bearer) for the Virgin Mary, which led to the Nestorian controversy. He was condemned at the Council of Ephesus (431) for his Christological teachings, which were seen as dividing Christ into two separate persons. His teachings led to the formation of the Church of the East (Nestorian Church).",
