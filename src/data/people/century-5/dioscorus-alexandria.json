  "summary": "Dioscorus was Patriarch of Alexandria from 444 to 451 who supported Eutyches and Monophysitism. He presided over the 'Robber Council' of Ephesus in 449, which reinstated Eutyches and deposed Flavian of Constantinople. The council was later repudiated and Dioscorus was deposed and excommunicated at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which condemned Monophysitism and affirmed the doctrine of two natures in one person. His deposition led to the schism between the Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian churches. The Coptic Orthodox Church considers him a saint.",
