  "summary": "Julian of Norwich was an English anchoress and mystic who lived in a cell attached to St. Julian's Church in Norwich. She is best known for her work 'Revelations of Divine Love' (also known as 'Showings'), which is the first book written in English by a woman. She received a series of visions during a serious illness, which she recorded and later expanded. Her theology emphasizes God's love and mercy, and she is known for saying 'All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.'",
