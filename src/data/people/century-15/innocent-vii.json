  "summary": "Innocent VII, born Cosimo Gentile Migliorati, was Pope from 1404 to 1406 during the Western Schism. He was one of the Roman popes during this period when there were competing claimants to the papacy. He worked to end the schism and restore unity to the Church. He supported learning and established a library. However, he was unable to resolve the schism during his brief pontificate. His papacy reflects the complex politics of the Great Schism period.",
