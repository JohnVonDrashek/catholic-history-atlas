  "summary": "Callixtus III, born Alfonso de Borgia, was Pope from 1455 to 1458. He was the first Spanish pope and a member of the Borgia family. He is best known for reversing the condemnation of Joan of Arc and declaring her innocence. He tried to organize a crusade against the Ottoman Turks after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, but was largely unsuccessful. He appointed two of his nephews as cardinals, including Rodrigo Borgia (later Pope Alexander VI). He was a patron of the arts and learning.",
