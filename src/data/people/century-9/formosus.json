  "summary": "Formosus was Pope from 891 to 896. He is best known for the Cadaver Synod (Synodus Horrenda) in 897, when his corpse was exhumed, tried, and posthumously condemned by his successor Stephen VI. This macabre event reflected the political chaos of the time. Formosus had been a missionary to Bulgaria and later bishop of Porto before becoming pope. His papacy was marked by conflicts with the Holy Roman Emperor and Italian nobles.",
