  "summary": "Sergius II was Pope from 844 to 847. His papacy was marked by the Saracen sack of Rome in 846, when Muslim raiders attacked the city and desecrated St. Peter's Basilica. This event shocked Christendom and led to increased fortification of Rome. He was involved in conflicts with Emperor Lothair I over papal elections and imperial authority.",
