  "summary": "Stephen IV (sometimes numbered as Stephen V due to confusion with Pope Stephen II) was Pope from 816 to 817. His brief pontificate was marked by his coronation of Louis the Pious as Holy Roman Emperor. He worked to maintain good relations with the Carolingian Empire and confirmed various privileges. He died after only about seven months in office. His papacy reflects the close relationship between the papacy and the Carolingian emperors.",
