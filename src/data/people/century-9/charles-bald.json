He was the youngest son of Louis the Pious and received West Francia (roughly modern France) in the Treaty of Verdun. He was a patron of learning and the arts, continuing the Carolingian Renaissance. He worked closely with Hincmar of Reims and supported the Church. His reign saw the continued fragmentation of the Carolingian Empire and the rise of regional powers.",
