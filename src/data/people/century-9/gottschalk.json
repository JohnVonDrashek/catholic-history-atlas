  "summary": "Gottschalk of Orbais was a 9th-century Benedictine monk and theologian. He is best known for his teachings on double predestination, which were condemned as heretical. He taught that God predestined both the elect to salvation and the reprobate to damnation. His views were opposed by Hincmar of Reims and other churchmen. He was condemned at the Council of Quierzy in 849 and spent the rest of his life in monastic confinement. His case represents an important moment in medieval predestination theology.",
