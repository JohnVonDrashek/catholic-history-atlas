  "summary": "Valentine was Pope for only about one month in 827. His brief pontificate occurred during a period of political instability in Rome. He was elected in August 827 and died in September of the same year. Very little is known about his pontificate due to its extreme brevity. His papacy reflects the turbulent politics of 9th-century Rome.",
