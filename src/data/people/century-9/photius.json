  "summary": "Photius was Patriarch of Constantinople from 858 to 867 and again from 877 to 886. He is one of the most important figures in Byzantine history and a key figure in the Photian Schism, which created tensions between the Eastern and Western Churches. He was a brilliant scholar and theologian, known for his Bibliotheca, a summary of 280 books. He opposed papal claims to universal jurisdiction and the Filioque clause. The schism was eventually resolved, but it foreshadowed the Great Schism of 1054.",
