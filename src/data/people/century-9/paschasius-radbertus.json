  "summary": "Paschasius Radbertus was a Benedictine monk, abbot, and theologian at Corbie Abbey. He is best known for his work De corpore et sanguine Domini (On the Body and Blood of the Lord), which was one of the first systematic treatments of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. His work influenced later Eucharistic theology, though it was controversial in his own time and was responded to by Ratramnus. He was an important figure in the Carolingian Renaissance.",
