  "summary": "Louis the Pious was Holy Roman Emperor from 814 to 840, succeeding his father Charlemagne. He was known for his deep piety and efforts to reform the Church and empire. He worked closely with Benedict of Aniane to reform monasticism. His reign was marked by conflicts with his sons over the division of the empire, which eventually led to the Treaty of Verdun in 843, dividing the Carolingian Empire into three parts. His piety earned him his epithet but also made him vulnerable to manipulation by his advisors.",
