  "summary": "Nicholas II was Pope from 1059 to 1061. He is best known for the papal election decree of 1059, which established that only cardinals could elect the pope, reducing the influence of the Roman nobility and the Holy Roman Emperor in papal elections. This decree was a key step in the Gregorian Reforms and strengthened papal independence. He also worked to combat simony and clerical marriage.",
