  "summary": "John XVII, born Sicco, was Pope for only about six months in 1003. His brief pontificate occurred during a period of political instability in Rome, when the papacy was under the control of local Roman noble families. Very little is known about his pontificate due to its extreme brevity. His papacy reflects the turbulent politics of 10th and early 11th century Rome, when popes were frequently installed and removed by competing factions.",
