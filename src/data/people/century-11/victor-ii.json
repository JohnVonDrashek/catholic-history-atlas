  "summary": "Victor II, born Gebhard of Dollnstein-Hirschberg, was Pope from 1055 to 1057. He was German and had been a bishop before his election. He was a close advisor to Holy Roman Emperor Henry III, who had a strong influence on his election. He worked to continue the reform of the Church and strengthen papal authority. His brief pontificate occurred during the period leading up to the Investiture Controversy. He died shortly after the emperor, marking the end of an era of close cooperation between the papacy and the empire.",
