  "summary": "Gregory VII, born Hildebrand, was Pope from 1073 to 1085. He is one of the most important popes in history and a key figure in the Gregorian Reforms. He strongly asserted papal authority and fought against simony and clerical marriage. He is best known for the Investiture Controversy with Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, which culminated in Henry's penance at Canossa. His reforms strengthened the papacy and the Church's independence from secular rulers.",
