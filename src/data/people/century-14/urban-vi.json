  "summary": "Urban VI was Pope from 1378 to 1389. His election by the cardinals in Rome, followed by the election of an antipope (Clement VII) in Avignon, began the Western Schism that would divide the Church for nearly forty years. His harsh personality and strict reforms alienated many cardinals who then supported the Avignon claimant.",
