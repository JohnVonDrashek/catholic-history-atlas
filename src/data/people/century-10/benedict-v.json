  "summary": "Benedict V was Pope briefly in 964. His election was contested - he was elected by the Roman people after the death of Pope John XII, but Holy Roman Emperor Otto I had already designated Leo VIII as pope. Otto I deposed Benedict V and installed Leo VIII. Benedict V was exiled to Hamburg where he died. His brief and contested pontificate reflects the political manipulation of the papacy by secular rulers during the 10th century.",
