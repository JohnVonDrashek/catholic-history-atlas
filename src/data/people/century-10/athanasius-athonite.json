He established the cenobitic (communal) form of monasticism on Mount Athos, which became the dominant form. He was a spiritual father to many monks and helped organize the monastic community on the Holy Mountain. Mount Athos became one of the most important centers of Orthodox monasticism, a status it maintains to this day.",
