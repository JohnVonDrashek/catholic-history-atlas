  "summary": "John XI was Pope from 931 to 935. He was the son of Marozia, one of the most powerful women in Rome at the time, and possibly Pope Sergius III. His pontificate was dominated by his mother's political control. He was imprisoned by his half-brother Alberic II, who ruled Rome as a secular prince. His papacy reflects the corruption and political manipulation that characterized the period known as the 'Pornocracy' or 'Rule of the Harlots'.",
