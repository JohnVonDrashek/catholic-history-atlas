  "summary": "John XIII was Pope from 965 to 972. His pontificate was marked by conflicts with the Roman nobility, who briefly imprisoned him. He was restored to the papacy with the help of Emperor Otto I. He crowned Otto I as Holy Roman Emperor in 962 and worked to strengthen the relationship between the papacy and the empire. He also established the archbishopric of Magdeburg to support missionary work among the Slavs.",
