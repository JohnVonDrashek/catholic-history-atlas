Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, objected to calling Mary 'Theotokos' (God-bearer), preferring 'Christotokos' (Christ-bearer). This was condemned at the Council of Ephesus (431), leading to a schism with the Church of the East.",

Over 520 bishops attended, making it the largest and best-documented of the first seven ecumenical councils.",
