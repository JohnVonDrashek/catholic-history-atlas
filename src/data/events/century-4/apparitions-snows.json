  "summary": "According to tradition, on August 5, 352, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared in a dream to Pope Liberius and a Roman patrician named John, asking them to build a church where snow would fall. The next morning, snow miraculously fell on the Esquiline Hill in Rome during the heat of summer, outlining the shape of the future church. This led to the construction of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the four major basilicas of Rome. The feast of Our Lady of the Snows is celebrated on August 5.",
