  "summary": "Constantine the Great's conversion to Christianity, traditionally dated to 312 AD at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, marked a turning point in Church history. According to tradition, Constantine saw a vision of a cross in the sky with the words 'In this sign, you will conquer.' His subsequent victory and eventual legalization of Christianity transformed the Church's relationship with the Roman state.",
