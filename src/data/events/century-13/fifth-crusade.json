  "summary": "The Fifth Crusade was launched in 1217 with the goal of conquering Egypt as a stepping stone to recapturing Jerusalem. The crusaders captured the port city of Damietta but were eventually forced to retreat after a failed attack on Cairo. The crusade ended in failure, though it did result in a temporary truce with the Ayyubid sultan.",
