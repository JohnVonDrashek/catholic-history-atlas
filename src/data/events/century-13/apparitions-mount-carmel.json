  "summary": "On July 16, 1251, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Simon Stock, Prior General of the Carmelite Order, in Cambridge, England. Our Lady gave him the Brown Scapular and promised that those who wear it devoutly would be saved from eternal fire. This apparition established the devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the Brown Scapular, which became one of the most popular Marian devotions in the Catholic Church. The feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated on July 16.",
