  "summary": "According to tradition, in 1294, the Holy House of Nazareth, where the Annunciation took place and where the Holy Family lived, was miraculously transported by angels from Palestine to Loreto, Italy. The house, which contains the original walls of Mary's home, became one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Europe. The Basilica of the Holy House of Loreto was built around it, and it has been visited by numerous popes and saints. The shrine is considered one of the most sacred places in Catholicism.",
