  "summary": "The Fourth Crusade was launched in 1202 with the intention of recapturing Jerusalem. However, the crusade was diverted to Constantinople, which was sacked in 1204. This event deepened the schism between Eastern and Western Christianity and established the Latin Empire of Constantinople. The crusade never reached the Holy Land.",
