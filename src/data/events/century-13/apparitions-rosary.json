  "summary": "In 1214, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Dominic in the church of Prouille, near Toulouse, France. Our Lady gave St. Dominic the Rosary as a weapon against heresy and instructed him to preach it. This apparition is credited with the origin of the Rosary devotion, which became one of the most important and widespread Catholic devotions. The Rosary played a crucial role in the fight against the Albigensian heresy and has been promoted by numerous popes throughout history.",
