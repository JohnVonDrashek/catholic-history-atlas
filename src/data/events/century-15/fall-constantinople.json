  "summary": "The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 marked the end of the Byzantine Empire and had profound consequences for Christianity. The city had been the center of Eastern Christianity for over a thousand years. The fall led to the migration of Greek scholars to the West, contributing to the Renaissance, and permanently changed the balance of power between Christianity and Islam.",
