  "summary": "Girolamo Savonarola, a Dominican friar, led a moral and religious reform movement in Florence from 1494 to 1498. He criticized the corruption of the Church and the Medici family, calling for repentance and reform. His influence led to the 'Bonfire of the Vanities' where luxury items were burned. However, he was eventually excommunicated and executed by the authorities.",
