  "summary": "The Cluniac Reforms were a series of changes within Western monasticism focused on restoring the observance of the Rule of St. Benedict. The reforms emphasized liturgical prayer, strict adherence to monastic discipline, and independence from secular control. The movement spread throughout Europe, with hundreds of monasteries joining the Cluniac congregation. The reforms helped strengthen the Church and contributed to the Gregorian Reforms of the 11th century.",
