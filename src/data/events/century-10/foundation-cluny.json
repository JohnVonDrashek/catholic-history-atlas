  "summary": "Cluny Abbey was founded in 910 by William I, Duke of Aquitaine. The abbey was established with a charter that granted it independence from local feudal control, placing it directly under papal authority. This foundation marked the beginning of the Cluniac Reforms, a movement that would transform Western monasticism and strengthen the Church's independence from secular powers. Cluny became one of the most influential monasteries in medieval Europe.",
