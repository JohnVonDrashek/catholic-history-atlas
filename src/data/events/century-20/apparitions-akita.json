  "summary": "Between 1973 and 1981, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Sister Agnes Katsuko Sasagawa in Akita, Japan. Our Lady delivered three messages warning of coming chastisements if humanity did not repent and pray. The apparitions were accompanied by a statue of Mary that wept 101 times and bled from a wound. The messages emphasized the importance of prayer, penance, and the Rosary. The apparitions were approved by the local bishop in 1984, making Our Lady of Akita the first approved Marian apparition in Japan.",
