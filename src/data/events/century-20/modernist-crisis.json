  "summary": "The Modernist Crisis was a period of conflict within the Catholic Church in the early 20th century. Pope Pius X issued the encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis in 1907, condemning Modernism as 'the synthesis of all heresies.' The crisis led to the implementation of anti-Modernist oaths and restrictions on biblical scholarship and theological education.",
