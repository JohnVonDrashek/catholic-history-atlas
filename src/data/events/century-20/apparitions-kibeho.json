  "summary": "Between November 28, 1981 and November 28, 1989, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to several students at a school in Kibeho, Rwanda. The main visionary was Alphonsine Mumureke, and Our Lady identified herself as 'Nyina wa Jambo' (Mother of the Word). The apparitions delivered urgent messages about prayer, penance, and the need for conversion, warning of coming tragedies if people did not repent. The apparitions were approved by the local bishop in 2001, making Our Lady of Kibeho the first approved Marian apparition in Africa. The messages are seen by many as prophetic warnings of the Rwandan genocide.",
