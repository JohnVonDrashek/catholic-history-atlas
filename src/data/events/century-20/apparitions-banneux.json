  "summary": "Between January 15 and March 2, 1933, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared eight times to 11-year-old Mariette Beco in Banneux, Belgium. Our Lady identified herself as the 'Virgin of the Poor' and asked for a chapel to be built. She also revealed a spring with healing properties. The apparitions emphasized Mary's care for the poor and suffering. The apparitions were approved by the Church in 1949, and Banneux became a major pilgrimage site, particularly for the sick and poor.",
