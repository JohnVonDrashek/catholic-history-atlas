  "summary": "The Second Vatican Council, commonly known as Vatican II, was the 21st ecumenical council of the Catholic Church. It was convened by Pope John XXIII in 1962 and continued under Pope Paul VI until 1965. The council brought about the most significant changes to Catholic liturgy, theology, and practice since the Council of Trent, including the Mass in vernacular languages, greater emphasis on the role of the laity, ecumenism, and religious freedom.",
