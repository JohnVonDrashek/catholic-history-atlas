  "summary": "During the Holocaust, many Catholics, including clergy and religious, risked their lives to save Jews from persecution. Individual Catholics and religious orders hid Jews, provided false documents, and helped them escape. However, the institutional response of the Church hierarchy remains a subject of historical debate, with questions about whether more could have been done to publicly condemn and resist the genocide.",
