  "summary": "Beginning on June 24, 1981, the Blessed Virgin Mary began appearing to six children in Medjugorje, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our Lady identified herself as the 'Queen of Peace' and has delivered messages about peace, prayer, fasting, conversion, and reconciliation. The apparitions have continued for decades, with some visionaries receiving daily messages. While the apparitions have not been officially approved by the Vatican, they have been permitted for pilgrimage since 2019, and Medjugorje has become one of the most visited Marian shrines in the world, attracting millions of pilgrims annually.",
