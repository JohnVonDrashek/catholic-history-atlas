  "summary": "Between May 13 and October 13, 1917, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to three shepherd children—Lucia dos Santos, Francisco Marto, and Jacinta Marto—in Fátima, Portugal. The apparitions delivered messages about prayer, penance, the consecration of Russia, and the importance of the Rosary. The final apparition on October 13 was witnessed by thousands of people and included the 'Miracle of the Sun,' where the sun appeared to dance in the sky. The apparitions were approved by the Church in 1930, and Fátima became one of the most important Marian pilgrimage sites in the world.",
