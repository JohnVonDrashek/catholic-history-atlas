  "summary": "Pope Benedict XV made extensive efforts to end World War I and promote peace. He issued the encyclical Ad beatissimi Apostolorum in 1914 calling for peace and neutrality. Throughout the war, he worked as a mediator, provided humanitarian aid, and condemned the conflict as 'the suicide of civilized Europe.' His peace plan in 1917, though rejected by warring parties, foreshadowed future peace initiatives.",
