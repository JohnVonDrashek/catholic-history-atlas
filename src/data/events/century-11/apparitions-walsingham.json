  "summary": "In 1061, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Richeldis de Faverches, a noblewoman in Walsingham, England. Our Lady showed Richeldis the house of the Annunciation in Nazareth and asked her to build a replica in Walsingham. This became the Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham, one of the most important Marian shrines in medieval England. The shrine attracted pilgrims from across Europe until its destruction during the English Reformation. It was later restored and remains an important pilgrimage site.",
