  "summary": "The Great Schism of 1054 was the formal split between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. The schism was the culmination of centuries of growing theological, political, and cultural differences. The immediate cause was the mutual excommunication of Pope Leo IX and Patriarch Michael I Cerularius. This schism divided Christendom and remains to this day, though efforts at reconciliation have been made.",
