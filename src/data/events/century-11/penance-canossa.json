  "summary": "The Penance at Canossa was a dramatic event in 1077 when Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV stood barefoot in the snow for three days outside the castle of Canossa, seeking absolution from Pope Gregory VII. Henry had been excommunicated for his defiance of the pope's ban on lay investiture. The event symbolized the power of the papacy over secular rulers, though the conflict would continue for decades.",
