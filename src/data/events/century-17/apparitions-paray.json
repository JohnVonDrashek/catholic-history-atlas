  "summary": "Between 1673 and 1675, St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, a Visitation nun in Paray-le-Monial, France, received a series of visions of Jesus Christ revealing his Sacred Heart. These apparitions emphasized Christ's love for humanity and led to the establishment of the Feast of the Sacred Heart and the practice of First Friday devotions. The devotion spread throughout the Catholic world and became one of the most popular devotions in the Church.",
