  "summary": "Between 1664 and 1718, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared approximately 2,000 times to Benoîte Rencurel, a shepherdess in Laus, France. Our Lady asked for a church to be built and revealed a spring with healing properties. The apparitions emphasized the importance of confession and conversion. The shrine at Laus became known for miraculous healings and conversions. The apparitions were approved by the Church in 2008, making Our Lady of Laus the first approved apparition in France since Lourdes.",
