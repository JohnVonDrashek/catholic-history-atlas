  "summary": "The Third Council of Constantinople was the sixth ecumenical council, convened by Emperor Constantine IV in 680-681 AD. The council condemned Monothelitism, the doctrine that Christ had only one will, and affirmed that Christ has both a divine will and a human will. This council, along with the Second Council of Constantinople, completed the Christological definitions of the earlier councils.",
