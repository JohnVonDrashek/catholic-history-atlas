  "summary": "The rise of Islam began with the revelations received by Muhammad in Mecca starting around 610 AD. Islam spread rapidly throughout the Arabian Peninsula and beyond, creating a new religious and political force that would have profound effects on the Christian world. The rapid expansion of Islamic territories would lead to the loss of many Christian lands in the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain.",
