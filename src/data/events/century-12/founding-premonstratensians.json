  "summary": "The Premonstratensian Order, also known as the Norbertines or White Canons, was founded by St. Norbert of Xanten in 1120 at Prémontré in France. The order combined the active ministry of canons regular with the contemplative life of monks, following the Rule of St. Augustine. The Premonstratensians became one of the most successful religious orders of the Middle Ages, establishing hundreds of monasteries throughout Europe. They were known for their pastoral work, education, and missionary activities.",
