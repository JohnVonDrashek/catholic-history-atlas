  "summary": "The Battle of Hattin was fought on July 4, 1187, between the Crusader army led by King Guy of Jerusalem and the forces of Saladin. The battle was a decisive victory for Saladin, who captured King Guy and destroyed much of the Crusader army. The defeat left the Crusader states vulnerable and led directly to the fall of Jerusalem and most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to Saladin's forces. The battle is considered one of the most significant military engagements of the Crusades.",
