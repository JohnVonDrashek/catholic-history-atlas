  "summary": "The Concordat of Worms was an agreement reached in 1122 between Pope Callixtus II and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V that ended the Investiture Controversy, a conflict that had lasted for over 50 years over the right to appoint bishops and abbots. The concordat established a compromise: the emperor would invest bishops with their temporal authority (the regalia), while the pope would invest them with their spiritual authority (the ring and staff). This agreement marked a significant victory for the papacy and established the principle of the Church's independence in spiritual matters.",
