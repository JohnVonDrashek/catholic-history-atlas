  "summary": "In 1187, the Muslim leader Saladin captured Jerusalem from the Crusader Kingdom, ending 88 years of Christian control of the holy city. The fall came after Saladin's decisive victory at the Battle of Hattin, where he captured King Guy of Jerusalem and destroyed much of the Crusader army. Unlike the brutal capture of Jerusalem by the First Crusade in 1099, Saladin allowed the Christian inhabitants to leave peacefully upon payment of a ransom. The fall of Jerusalem shocked Europe and led to the calling of the Third Crusade.",
