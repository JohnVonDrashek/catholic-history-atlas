  "summary": "The Second Crusade was called by Pope Eugene III in response to the fall of the County of Edessa to the forces of Zengi in 1144. Led by King Louis VII of France and King Conrad III of Germany, the crusade was a military failure. The crusaders failed to recapture Edessa and suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Dorylaeum. However, the crusade did achieve some success in the Iberian Peninsula and the Baltic region. The failure of the Second Crusade was a major setback for the crusading movement.",
