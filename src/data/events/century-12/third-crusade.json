  "summary": "The Third Crusade, also known as the Kings' Crusade, was called by Pope Gregory VIII after the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187. It was led by three of Europe's most powerful monarchs: Richard I of England (Richard the Lionheart), Philip II of France, and Frederick I Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire. While the crusade failed to recapture Jerusalem, it did succeed in capturing the important coastal city of Acre and establishing a truce with Saladin that allowed Christian pilgrims access to Jerusalem. The crusade is famous for the military prowess of Richard the Lionheart and his encounters with Saladin.",
