  "summary": "The Hundred Years' War was a series of conflicts between England and France from 1337 to 1453. The war had significant implications for the Church, as both sides sought papal support, and the conflict complicated the already divisive Western Schism. Popes attempted to mediate peace, and the war affected relations between the English and French Churches. The war contributed to the weakening of feudalism and the rise of nation-states.",
