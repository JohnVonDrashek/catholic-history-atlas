  "summary": "The Avignon Papacy, also known as the Babylonian Captivity, was the period from 1309 to 1377 when seven consecutive popes resided in Avignon, France, rather than Rome. This period began under Pope Clement V, who moved the papal court to Avignon under pressure from the French king. The period saw the papacy fall under French influence and led to widespread criticism and calls for reform. The papacy was finally returned to Rome by Pope Gregory XI.",
