  "summary": "The Nestorian controversy was a major theological dispute in the 5th century over the nature of Christ. Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, objected to calling Mary 'Theotokos' (God-bearer), preferring 'Christotokos' (Christ-bearer). This was condemned at the Council of Ephesus (431), leading to a schism with the Church of the East.",
