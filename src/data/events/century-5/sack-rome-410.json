  "summary": "The Sack of Rome by the Visigoths under Alaric I in 410 AD was a pivotal event that shocked the Roman world. It was the first time in nearly 800 years that Rome had been captured by a foreign enemy. This event had profound psychological and theological implications, leading Augustine to write 'The City of God' in response to claims that Christianity had weakened Rome.",
