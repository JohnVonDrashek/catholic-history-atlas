  "summary": "The Mission to the Slavs was undertaken by the brothers Cyril and Methodius, who were sent by the Byzantine Emperor to evangelize the Slavic peoples of Moravia. They created the Glagolitic alphabet and translated the Bible and liturgical texts into Old Church Slavonic. Their work laid the foundation for Slavic Christianity and culture, though they faced opposition from German bishops who preferred Latin.",
