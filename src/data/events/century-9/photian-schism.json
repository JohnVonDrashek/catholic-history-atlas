  "summary": "The Photian Schism was a conflict between Pope Nicholas I and Photius, Patriarch of Constantinople, from 863 to 867. The dispute arose over Photius's appointment as patriarch and his criticism of Western practices, particularly the Filioque clause. Although the schism was eventually resolved, it highlighted growing tensions between the Eastern and Western Churches that would eventually lead to the Great Schism of 1054.",
