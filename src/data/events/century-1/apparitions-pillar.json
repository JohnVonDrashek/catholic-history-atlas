  "summary": "According to tradition, in 40 AD, while St. James the Apostle was preaching in Spain, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to him in Zaragoza, standing on a pillar. This is believed to be the first Marian apparition in history, occurring while Mary was still alive on Earth. Our Lady gave St. James a small wooden statue of herself and a pillar of jasper, asking him to build a church. The Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza is one of the most important Marian shrines in Spain and the first church dedicated to Mary.",
