  "summary": "The Novatian Schism began in 251 AD when Novatian, a Roman presbyter, was consecrated as an antipope in opposition to Pope Cornelius. Novatian and his followers, known as Novatianists, held that those who had lapsed during persecution could not be readmitted to the Church, even after penance. The schism lasted for several centuries and was eventually condemned by the Church.",
