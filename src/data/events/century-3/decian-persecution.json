  "summary": "The Decian persecution (250-251 AD) was the first empire-wide, systematic persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. Emperor Decius issued an edict requiring all citizens to perform a sacrifice to the Roman gods and obtain a certificate (libellus) proving their compliance. Many Christians refused and were martyred, while others lapsed and later sought readmission to the Church, leading to debates about penance and reconciliation.",
