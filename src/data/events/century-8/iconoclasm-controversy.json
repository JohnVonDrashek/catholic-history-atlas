  "summary": "The Iconoclasm Controversy was a major theological dispute in the Byzantine Empire over the use of religious images (icons). Emperor Leo III began the first period of iconoclasm in 726, ordering the destruction of icons. The controversy divided the Church and Empire for over a century, with periods of iconoclasm and restoration. It was finally resolved at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which affirmed the veneration of icons.",
