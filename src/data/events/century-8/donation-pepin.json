  "summary": "The Donation of Pepin was a grant of land made by Pepin the Short, King of the Franks, to Pope Stephen II in 754 and confirmed in 756. This donation established the Papal States, giving the Pope temporal power over central Italy. This was a crucial development in the relationship between the papacy and secular rulers and established the foundation for the Papal States that would last until 1870.",
