  "summary": "St. Teresa of Avila, with the help of St. John of the Cross, reformed the Carmelite Order, establishing the Discalced (barefoot) Carmelites. The reform emphasized a return to the original contemplative and austere spirit of the order, with strict observance of poverty, prayer, and solitude. The reformed Carmelites became a major force in the Counter-Reformation and produced many mystics and saints.",
