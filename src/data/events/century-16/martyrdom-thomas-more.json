  "summary": "St. Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England, was executed for refusing to acknowledge King Henry VIII as the head of the Church of England. More, a lawyer, scholar, and humanist, chose death rather than compromise his Catholic faith. He is the patron saint of lawyers and statesmen and is remembered for his famous words: 'I die the king's good servant, but God's first.'",
