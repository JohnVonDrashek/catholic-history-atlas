  "summary": "Beginning in 1597, the Japanese government under Toyotomi Hideyoshi and later the Tokugawa shogunate began systematic persecution of Christians. The first major persecution resulted in the crucifixion of 26 martyrs in Nagasaki, including six Franciscan missionaries and 20 Japanese converts. This marked the beginning of over two centuries of severe persecution that nearly eliminated Christianity from Japan.",
