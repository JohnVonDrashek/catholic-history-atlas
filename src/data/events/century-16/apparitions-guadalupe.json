  "summary": "The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Juan Diego, an indigenous convert, on Tepeyac Hill near Mexico City in December 1531. The apparition left her image imprinted on Juan Diego's tilma (cloak), which remains preserved to this day. Our Lady of Guadalupe became the patroness of the Americas and played a crucial role in the evangelization of Mexico, leading to millions of conversions. The image on the tilma has been the subject of scientific study and remains unexplained.",
