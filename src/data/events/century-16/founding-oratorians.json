The Oratorians were a community of secular priests living together without vows, dedicated to prayer, preaching, and the sacraments. The order emphasized joy, simplicity, and service to the poor. The Oratory spread throughout Italy and later to other countries, becoming an important part of the Counter-Reformation.",
