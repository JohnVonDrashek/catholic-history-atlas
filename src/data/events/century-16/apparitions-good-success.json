  "summary": "Between 1594 and 1634, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Mother Mariana de Jesús Torres, a Spanish nun in Quito, Ecuador. Our Lady of Good Success delivered prophecies about future crises in the Church and the world, including warnings about moral decay and the need for prayer and penance. The apparitions included the miraculous completion of a statue of Our Lady of Good Success. The apparitions were approved by the local bishop in 1611 and have been recognized by subsequent Church authorities.",
