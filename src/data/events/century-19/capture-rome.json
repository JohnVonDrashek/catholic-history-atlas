  "summary": "On September 20, 1870, Italian troops breached the walls of Rome and captured the city, ending the temporal power of the papacy and the Papal States that had existed for over a thousand years. Pope Pius IX declared himself a 'prisoner in the Vatican' and refused to recognize the Italian state. This situation, known as the Roman Question, would last until the Lateran Treaty of 1929.",
