During the apparitions, Our Lady revealed the design for what would become known as the Miraculous Medal, showing Mary standing on a globe with rays of light emanating from her hands. The medal became one of the most popular Catholic devotional items, with millions distributed worldwide. The apparitions were approved by the Church in 1836.",
