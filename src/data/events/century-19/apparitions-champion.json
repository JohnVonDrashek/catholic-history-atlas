  "summary": "On October 9, 1859, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Adele Brise, a young Belgian immigrant, in Champion, Wisconsin (then called Robinsonville). Our Lady identified herself as the 'Queen of Heaven' and asked Adele to teach children the Catholic faith. The apparition occurred three times, and Our Lady promised that if Adele did as asked, she would have nothing to fear. The shrine became a place of pilgrimage, and the apparitions were approved by the local bishop in 2010, making Our Lady of Good Help the first and only approved Marian apparition in the United States.",
