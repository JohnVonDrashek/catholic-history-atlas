  "summary": "On January 17, 1871, during the Franco-Prussian War, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to several children in the small village of Pontmain, France. The apparition appeared in the sky above a barn, showing Mary in a blue dress with a golden crown, holding a red cross. A message appeared: 'But pray, my children. God will hear you in a short time. My Son allows Himself to be moved.' The apparition was approved by the Church in 1872, and Pontmain became a pilgrimage site. The apparition is credited with helping to end the war.",
