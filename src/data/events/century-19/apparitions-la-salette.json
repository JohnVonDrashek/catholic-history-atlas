  "summary": "On September 19, 1846, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to two shepherd children, Mélanie Calvat and Maximin Giraud, near the village of La Salette-Fallavaux in the French Alps. The apparition, weeping, delivered a message calling for conversion, penance, and prayer, warning of coming chastisements if people did not amend their lives. The message emphasized the importance of keeping the Lord's Day holy and the need for repentance. The apparition was approved by the Church in 1851.",
