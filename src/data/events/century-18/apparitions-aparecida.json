  "summary": "In October 1717, three fishermen in the Paraíba River near Aparecida, Brazil, found a small statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary in their nets. The statue, which became known as Our Lady of Aparecida (Aparecida meaning 'appeared'), was found in two pieces but miraculously became whole. Numerous miracles were attributed to the statue, and it became the patroness of Brazil. The Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida is the second largest Catholic church in the world and attracts millions of pilgrims annually.",
