  "summary": "The French Revolution brought severe persecution to the Catholic Church in France. The Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) attempted to subordinate the Church to the state, leading to a schism. Many priests and religious were executed, churches were desecrated, and the Church's property was confiscated. The Reign of Terror (1793-1794) saw the execution of thousands of clergy and religious.",
