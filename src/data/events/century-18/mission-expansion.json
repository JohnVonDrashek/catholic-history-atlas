  "summary": "Despite challenges in Europe, Catholic missionary activity continued to expand in the 18th century. Missionaries worked in the Americas, Asia, and Africa. The Jesuits, before their suppression, were particularly active in China, India, and South America. The Reductions of Paraguay, Jesuit missions among the Guarani people, reached their peak before being destroyed by Spanish and Portuguese forces in the 1750s.",
