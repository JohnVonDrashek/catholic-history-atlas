  "summary": "Montanism, also known as the New Prophecy, was an early Christian movement founded by Montanus in Phrygia around 165 AD. It emphasized prophetic revelation, ecstatic utterances, and strict asceticism. The movement was eventually condemned as heretical, but it influenced Christian thinking about prophecy, the Holy Spirit, and eschatology.",
